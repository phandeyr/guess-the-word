# Guess the Word 
A text based game written in Python 3 which validates the user input and checks to see if the character they have entered is within the word to guess which is picked randomly.

The user has 8 guesses and informed of how many guesses they have remaining, as well as if the character they have picked is in the word and where it is located.
